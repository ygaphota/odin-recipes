      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
	  <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion (1 onion)</li>
	  <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
	  <li>1 1/2  lbs sweet Italian turkey sausage, casings removed</li>
	  <li>One 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes in tomato puree</li>
	  <li>One 6 oz. can tomato paste</li>
	  <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
	  <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
	  <li>3/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
	  <li>1/2 lb lasagna noodles</li>
	  <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
	  <li>3 to 4 oz creamy goat cheese, crumbled</li>
	  <li>1 cup grated Parmesan, plus 1/4 cup for sprinkling</li>
	  <li>1 extra-large egg, lightly beaten</li>
	  <li>1 lb. fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced</li>
	</ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
	  <li>Heat the olive oil in a large (10 to 12 inch) skillet. Add the onion and cook for 1 more minute. Add the sausage and cook over medium-low heat, breaking it up with a fork, for 8 to 10 minutes, until no longer pink. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 Tbsp. of the parsley, the basil, 1 1/2 tsp. of the salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat, for 15 - 20 minutes, until thickened.</li>
	  <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with the hottest tap water. Add the noodles and allow them to sit in the water for 20 minutes. Drain</li>
	  <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, goat cheese, 1 cup of Parmesan, the egg, the remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Set aside.</li>
	  <li>Ladel 1/3 of the sauce into a 9 by 12 by 2-inch rectangular baking dish, spreading the sauce over the bottom of the dish. Then add the layers as follows: half the pasta, half the mozzarella, half the ricotta, and 1/3 of the sauce. Add the rest of the pasta, mozzarella, ricotta, and finally, sauce. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling.</li>
