    <h2>A rich, gooey and delicious treat</h2>
      <p>One of the first desserts I ever made for my future wife many years ago, fourless chocolate cake is an indulgant and delicious way to wrap up a dinner, especially if it's a special occasion.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <h4>Cake</h4>
        <ul>
	  <li>1 cup (170 g) semisweet chocolate chips or bittersweet chocolate chips</li>
	  <li>8 Tbsp (113g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
	  <li>3/4 cup (149g) granulated sugar</li>
	  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
	  <li>1 to 2 tsp espresso powder (optional)</li>
	  <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract (optional)</li>
	  <li>3 large eggs</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup (42g) Dutch-process cocoa</li>
	</ul>
      <h4>Glaze</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>1 cup (170 g) semisweet chocolate chips or bittersweet chocolate chips</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup (113g) heavy cream</li>
	</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease a metal 8" round cake pan; cut a piece of parchment to fit, grease it, and lay it in the bottom of the pan.</li>
	  <li><strong>To make the cake:</strong> Put the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat until the butter is melted and the chips are soft. Stir until the chips melt, reheating briefly if necessary. You can also do this over a burner set at very low heat. Transfer the melted chocolate/butter to a mixing bowl.</li>
	  <li>Stir in the sugar, salt, espresso powder and vanilla. Espresso enhances chocolate's flavor as much as vanilla does; using 1 tsp will simply enhance the flavor, while 2 tsp will lend a hint of mocha to the cake.</li>
	  <li>Add the eggs, beating briefly until smooth. Add the cocoa powder, and mix just to combine.</li>
	  <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
	  <li>Bake the cake for 25 minutes; the top will have formed a thin crust, and it should register at least 200 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer inserted into its center.</li>
	  <li>Remove it from the oven, and cool it in the pan for 5 minutes.</li>
	  <li>Loosen the edges of the pan with a table knife or nylon spreader, and turn it out onto a serving plate. The top will now be on the bottom; that's fine. Also, the edges will crumble a bit, which is also fine. Allow the cake to cool completely before glazing.</li>
	  <li><strong>To make the glaze:</strong> Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream until it's not quite at a simmer, but showing fine bubbles around the edge. Pour the cream over the chocolate, stir very briefly to combine, and let rest for 5 minutes. Stir again -- at first slowly, then more vigorously -- until the chocolate is completely melted and the glaze is smooth. If any bits of chocolate remain, reheat briefly in the microwave or over a burner, then stir until smooth.</li>
	  <li>Spoon the glaze over the cake, spreading it to drip over the sides a bit. Allow the glaze to set for several hours before serving the cake.</li>
	</ol>
