This is my first HTML project. In this project, I demonstrate the basics of HTML I have learned so far, including creating a homepage with several Relative links. Each of the Relative links demonstrate usage of Headings, Titles, Images (both via Relative (Fajitas) and Absolute (Cake and Lasagna) Links), Paragraphs and Lists (both Ordered and Unordered).
