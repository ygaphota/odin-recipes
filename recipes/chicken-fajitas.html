    <h2>Chicken, onions, and peppers with a homemade seasoning</h2>
      <p>This is a recipe I found a long time ago. I use it every time I make fajitas now, as my family all love and demand it.</p>
      <p>This is a fairly simple recipe, where we will end up making out own amazing spice blend and charring our vegetables to perfection.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <h4>Chicken Fajitas</h4>
	<ul>
          <li>3 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
	  <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
	  <li>3 bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
	  <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
	  <li>1/2 lime</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Fajita Seasoning</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>1/2 Tbsp chili powder</li>
	  <li>1/2 Tbsp ground cumin</li>
	  <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
	  <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
	  <li>1/2 tsp oregano</li>
	  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
	  <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>For Serving</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>tortillas</li>
	  <li>sour cream</li>
	  <li>pico de gallo</li>
	  <li>avocado</li>
	</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Add the fajitas seasoning ingredients to a small mixing bowl and stir together.</li>
	<li>Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both sides of the chicken and use your fingers to press it into the chicken.</li>
	<li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sear the chicken breasts for about 7-8 minutes on each side.</li>
	<li>While your chicken is cooking, cut the bell peppers and onion into thin slices.</li>
	<li>Once the chicken has finished cooking, remove it to a plate and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Add the bell peppers and onion to the same skillet over medium heat and saute for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
	<li>When the bell peppers are just about done sauteeing, slice the chicken breasts into strips.</li>
	<li>Add the chicken back into the skillet, add a squeeze of fresh lime juice and stir everything together.</li>
	<li>Serve immediately with tortillas and extra toppings such as sour cream, pico de gallo and guacamole.</li>
